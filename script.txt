To address these limitations, we propose \emph{Demon}, a novel stochastic optimization approach for preference optimization of diffusion models at inference time.
Demon is a metaphor from Maxwell's Demon, an imaginary manipulator of natural thermodynamic processes.
The core ideas are: 
(1) Quality of noises that seed different possible backward steps in a discretized reverse-time Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) can be evaluated given a reward source; 
(2) Such evaluation enables us to synthesize ``optimal'' noises that theoretically and empirically improve the final reward of the generated image through stochastic optimization.
Specifically, we leverage Probability Flow Ordinary Differential Equation (PF-ODE)~\citep{scoresde} or Consistency Model (CM)~\citep{consistency, lcm} to help us efficiently evaluate the possible backward steps, seeded with different Gaussian noises.

* Opening Hook
text2image are common tools for generating images from text. They, however, often require a lot of manual tweaking to get the desired result.
Have you ever wished that text2image could instantly understand and adapt to your unique visual preferences?
You may have the experience of using text2image tools while, ususally, there are images that are close to perfect, but there are always some that are not quite right. 


* Present the Challenge
The prior work usually involves training a proxy indicating human preferences to improve the quality of the generated images. 
This approach, however, is not only time-consuming for trainging but also possesses a severe hacking, which reaches a high score in the proxy but is not visually appealing.
We propose a new approach that can directly optimize the generated images to match the user's preferences.
