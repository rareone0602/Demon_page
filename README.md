# **Title:** Demons in Diffusion: Aligning Image Generation with User Preferences

---

### **Opening Hook (0:00 - 0:30)**

*Visuals:* A collage of AI-generated images appears on the screen—some are almost perfect, others miss the mark. The camera zooms into one image that's slightly off.

**Narration:**

"Have you ever used a text-to-image generator and thought, 'This is close, but not quite what I imagined'? Despite incredible advancements in AI, getting that *exact* image we envision often feels like a game of chance."

---

### **Presenting the Challenge (0:31 - 1:00)**

*Visuals:* A user repeatedly tweaking text prompts with minimal improvement. A clock ticking faster to indicate time consumption. A graph showing diminishing returns.

**Narration:**

"Typically, to refine these results, we either adjust our prompts endlessly or retrain models to better capture our preferences. But retraining is time-consuming and can lead to images that score high on technical metrics but don't satisfy us visually."

---

### **Introducing Our Solution (1:01 - 1:30)**

*Visuals:* Transition to a bright, inviting interface. The user's face lights up as they interact with the system.

**Narration:**

"What if there were a way for the AI to understand your preferences instantly, adapting on the fly without any retraining? Introducing our new approach—a method that directly aligns image generation with your unique tastes through simple, intuitive interaction."

---

### **Interactive Demonstration (1:31 - 2:30)**

*Visuals:* Show the user interface where a user inputs a text description or selects a reference image. Sixteen images populate the screen.

**Narration:**

"Here's how it works: You start by providing a text description or even a reference image. The system generates a set of images based on your input."

*Visuals:* The user clicks 'like' or 'dislike' buttons beneath each image.

"Now, you simply indicate which images you prefer. With each selection, the system learns and generates a new batch, progressively honing in on what you truly want."

*Visuals:* Successive rounds show images becoming more aligned with the user's preferences, perhaps morphing gradually.

"This interactive loop continues until you're satisfied with the result. No complex prompts, no technical adjustments—just straightforward feedback."

---

### **Delving into the Core Concept (2:31 - 3:00)**

*Visuals:* Transition to abstract representations—particles moving and forming patterns. Use smooth animations to represent concepts.

**Narration:**

"But how does this instant adaptation happen? It all revolves around a fascinating twist on how the AI generates images using something called a diffusion model."

---

### **Simplifying the Technical Insights (3:01 - 4:00)**

*Visuals:* Depict a cloud of particles (representing noise) gradually coalescing into a clear image. Overlay simple equations with key terms highlighted.

**Narration:**

"Diffusion models generate images by starting with random noise and refining it step by step to form a coherent picture. Think of it like sculpting a statue from a block of marble—gradually revealing the image hidden within."

*Visuals:* Show the 'sculpting' analogy, perhaps a block transforming into a statue.

"In each step, the model adds a bit of 'noise' to guide this process. Traditionally, this noise is entirely random, which means the model doesn't consider your personal preferences in that randomness."

---

### **Introducing the 'Demon' Algorithm (4:01 - 5:00)**

*Visuals:* Personify the 'Demon' as a friendly guide manipulating the noise—maybe a character adjusting sliders or directing traffic.

**Narration:**

"Here's where our innovation comes in: inspired by 'Maxwell's Demon'—an imaginary being that can sort particles to decrease entropy—we introduce our own 'Demon' into the diffusion process."

*Visuals:* The Demon observes different paths (represented by different noise samples) and selects the best ones.

"Instead of relying on purely random noise, our Demon evaluates multiple possible noises and intelligently combines them to steer the image generation toward your preferences."

*Visuals:* Show multiple paths branching out, with the Demon choosing and combining the ones leading to higher-quality images.

---

### **Making It Accessible (5:01 - 5:30)**

*Visuals:* Simplify the equations into visual elements. For example, show vectors combining on a sphere, highlighting the normalization process.

**Narration:**

"Mathematically, we take several random noise samples and assess how each influences the image quality. Then, we combine them in a way that 'nudges' the generation process in the right direction."

*Visuals:* Illustrate vectors (representing noise samples) being combined and projected onto a sphere.

"This ensures we're still operating within the model's framework while aligning the outputs with your preferences."

---

### **Deepening the Insight (5:31 - 6:30)**

*Visuals:* Show a sphere representing the high-dimensional space of noise. Demonstrate how random samples lie on its surface and how combining them affects the outcome.

**Narration:**

"In high-dimensional space, random noise vectors tend to lie on the surface of a sphere. By intelligently combining these vectors—our noise samples—we stay on this sphere but move in a direction that improves the image according to your feedback."

*Visuals:* Animate the process of vectors adding up, normalizing, and resulting in a new vector pointing toward desired outcomes.

"This approach allows us to guide the diffusion process without breaking the inherent structure of the model."

---

### **Showcasing Applications (6:31 - 7:00)**

*Visuals:* Display various domains where this method can be applied—custom artwork, personalized product designs, adaptive content generation.

**Narration:**

"This technique isn't just limited to images. Imagine personalized art creation, customized product designs, or any scenario where aligning outputs with user preferences is valuable."

---

### **Conclusion and Call to Action (7:01 - 7:30)**

*Visuals:* Return to the satisfied user, now viewing the perfect image. Fade in the title of your paper and contact information.

**Narration:**

"Our method transforms how we interact with AI-generated content, making it more personal and responsive. If you're intrigued and want to explore the details, check out our paper linked below."

### **Closing Scene (7:31 - 7:45)**

*Visuals:* A smooth animation of images aligning, perhaps forming your paper's title or a thank-you message.

**Narration:**

"Thank you for watching. Together, let's make AI work better—for you."
